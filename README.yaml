description: |-
  Create baseline common AWS account settings that are applied to every account in the organisation.   This tyically includes config like IAM roles, S3 buckets and general settings.

  ## Features

  ### Account Cost Saving -> EC2 Scheduling

  - Lambda function for scheduling start/stop of EC2 and RDS instances

  ### Identity and Access Management

  - Creates a ReadOnly role
  - Creates a Terraform role which is designed to be used by an automation pipeline

  ### S3 Buckets
  - Creates an audit bucket for S3 access logs

  ### KMS Key For Sensitive Data
  - A KMS key is created specifcally to enable Terraform to decrypt any sensitive data required for resources which require passwords

  ## EC2 Instance Scheduling
  Each account comes with the ablilty to tag EC2 instances in order to save costs by automatically stopping and starting at predefined schedules each day.
  By default EC2 instances will be stopped at 18:00 with no start time.  If you need a server running you can use the AWS Console to start instances again when you need them.
